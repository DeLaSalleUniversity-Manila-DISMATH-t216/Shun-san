# Shun-san
My pesonal DISMATH portfolio

##Week 1
+ We had our first introductions in this subject. At first I thought to myself, "What kind of subject is this" or "Is this even a subject".But it was actually an interesting subject about using logic and dealing with the unknown. I was really deep in thought when Melvin-san showed us the example of the knights and knaves. It was a question that is uncommon and we need to use the deepest part of our brains.  

+ We also discussed the first topics on this course: Truth tables and propositions. 

| p             | q             | p^q  |pvq  |pâ†’q|
| ------ |:-----:| -----:| -------: | ------:|
| T      | T| T |T |T|T|
| T      | F     |F    |T |F|
| F      | T      |F     |T |T|
| F      | F      |F   |F |T|

##Week 2
+ Another refreshing week, I have now been introduced to logical equivalences and tried to prove the laws behind it. Actually, it was really similar to algebra laws so it's kinda easy to learn and it was really fun proving these kinds of stuff.
+ I also learned existential and universal truths. It was really cool since all theories are cycling in these truths.
+ Yet again, this is a fun week on my DISMATH journey.

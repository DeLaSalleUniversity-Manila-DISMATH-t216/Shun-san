##Week 1
+ We had our first introductions in this subject. At first I thought to myself, "What kind of subject is this" or "Is this even a subject".But it was actually an interesting subject about using logic and dealing with the unknown. I was really deep in thought when Melvin-san showed us the example of the knights and knaves. It was a question that is uncommon and we need to use the deepest part of our brains.  

+ We also discussed the first topics on this course: Truth tables and propositions. 

| p             | q             | p^q  |pvq  |pâ†’q|
| ------ |:-----:| -----:| -------: | ------:|
| T      | T| T |T |T|T|
| T      | F     |F    |T |F|
| F      | T      |F     |T |T|
| F      | F      |F   |F |T|

##Week 2
+ Another refreshing week, I have now been introduced to logical equivalences and tried to prove the laws behind it. Actually, it was really similar to algebra laws so it's kinda easy to learn and it was really fun proving these kinds of stuff.
+ I also learned existential and universal truths. It was really cool since all theories are cycling in these truths.
+ Yet again, this is a fun week on my DISMATH journey.

##Week 3
**3rd week** in my DISMATH journey starts...
+ I learned about rules of inference:![alt text](http://i.imgur.com/U7gW41J.png "Logo Title Text 1")
+ And...![alt text](http://i.imgur.com/QVNO00B.png "Logo Title Text 1")
+ I also learned about the 4 methods of proof: Direct proof, Proof by Contaraposition, as well as, Vacuuos and Trivial Proof.

##Week 4
+ **Congratulations** for a month in my DISMATH journey!
+ This week was a week full of in depth lectures on the methods of proof and also multiple examples of each and also combination examples. I learned about **Mathematical Induction** which is already taught in ENGALG2, so I easily got the heart of the problems here.
+ A tip for mathematical induction is that you always need to have a basis before proving the problem stated since you will go into a loop if the first step is ignored.
+ Also, **Recursive statements** are also introduced which follows the arithmetic sequencs (also taught in high school), so its still easy-mid difficulty.
+ **Looking forward** to the next meetings of my DISMATH journey!
